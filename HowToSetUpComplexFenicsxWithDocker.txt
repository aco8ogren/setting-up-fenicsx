How to open this folder in the docker container:

1. Open VS Code.

2. Press ctrl+shift+p

3. Type 'Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container...'

4. Select setting-up-fenicsx.

VS Code will then open setting-up-fenicsx using the Docker image with the proper environment variables set to use the complex version of Fenicsx.
VS Code knows to do this by reading the information in setting-up-fenicsx/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json.

Then, as the Python kernel I use the 'recommended' one called 'Python 3.10.6' whose path is '/bin/python3.10'

For some reason, this uses the second 'quizzical_engelbart' container rather than the original container that I named fenicsx.
